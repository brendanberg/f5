def urlify(unused_handler, string):
    '''Return a string that has been munged to remove URL-unfriendly
    characters. This is not the same as URL encoding.

    Steps:
        1. Replace spaces with hyphens
        2. Replace any non-alphanumeric character or allowed punctuation with
            the empty string. (Allowed punctuation includes hyphens, forward
            slashes, and periods)
        3. Remove periods or commas that preceed a slash or hyphen
        4. Transform the string to lower case
    '''
    string = re.sub(r'[^A-Za-z0-9-/.]', '', re.sub(r' +', '-', string))
    return re.sub(r'[.,]([/-])', r'\1', string).lower()
